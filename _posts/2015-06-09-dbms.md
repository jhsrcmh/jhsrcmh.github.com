####1. DSMS
1. Abstract: DSMS(流数据管理系统)real-time, dynamic data, suporting for relatively fixed, real-timme, continous quries. DBMS:PULL, DSMS:push.
2. Application: sensor networkds, network traffic analysis, financial trickers, transaction log analysis, network click event analysis. etc.
3. data stream: a sequence of tuples which consist of a set of attributes, similar to a row in database table.includes transactional datastream, and log datastream.
4. motivation:
   * massive data sets
   * high detail data
   * near real-time analysis
   * traditional data feeds, near real-time.
   * break analysis 异常检测
   * performance of disk. Memory I/O is much faster than disk IO.
5. Requirements
   * data model and query semantics.
   * query processing
   * data reduction. most important in big data.
   * real-time reactions
   * long running queries
   * scalability
6. dsms architecture
   * functional architecture: input module -> system monitor->query tree(quick query)->output module.
   * 3-level architecture. most is online dealing with data based on memory.
7. data models
   * tuples (relation-based and object-based)
   * window model
     * sliding ---- most-used
     * jumping 
     * overlapping
   * timestamps
8. Queries
   * DBMS: one-time query, DSMS: continous query.
   * DBMS: exact query, DSMS, approximate query answer. data reduction(summary, poly(小波变换,近似搜索,BlingDB,query优化)), batch processing.
9. query lang. 
   * SQL-like
   * model defination language.
   * Selections and Projections. selections and projections are straighfoward.
   * Joins. like sql
   * Aggregations 聚集. like group, sum, count, min, max
10. query optimization
   * stream rate based
   * resource based
   * QoS based
11. data reduction tech
   * aggregation
   * load shedding
   * samping
   * sketches
   * wavelets
   * histograms.

####3. Intorduction of STORM
1. Storm
   实时分布式流计算系统.
2. Storm 解决方案
   * in memory
   * 进程常驻
   * 实时处理
   * DAG模型
   * queue + worker系统, Storm维护简单,扩展简单,自动容错.
3. Spout and Bolt.
   * Storm实战

####3. HANA

   内存计算,内存数据库
   大数据处理的热点: 压缩,增量,OLINE分析.CPU与MEMORY之间进行计算.热数据与冷数据分别处理

####4. 内存计算
